                            <p>This is the third and airy sign of the Zodiac, which is influenced by the planet Mercury. People born in this sign are tall, upright and have long hands and thin legs, sharp and long nose. Generally they have wheatish complexion.
                                They are known for their quick wit and intelligence. They are carefree and jovial by nature. They are highly enthusiastic and enterprising. They have a commendable memory and grasping power. They are active and cheerful,

                                baffle and infuriate their opponents in arguments.</p>

                                and reach out to people. The more intellectual Gemini's, in their quest to impress people with their views and opinions on various issues, will be constantly writing to the press, lecturing, appearing on TV discussions,
                                addressing meetings.</p>

                            <p>They should be careful not to overstrain their sensitive and highly-strung nervous system, which can break down under pressure. People whose sign or Mercury is afflicted in the birth chart develop negative traits. Lies, deceit,
                                inconsistency, superficiality and unreliability mark their personalities. If they can curb their negative traits like restlessness, impatience, inconsistency and dual nature then their success in life would be remarkable.</p>

                            <p>Leo, the fifth sign of the zodiac, is the central sign of the fiery triplicity. Ruled by Sun, there is nothing complicated about Leo - they are the king, the boss and the leader. They know that they are far better at organizing
                                everyone else's life than they are capable of. And if they accept it, all will be well. They are affectionate, enthusiastic, cheerful and optimistic people. Their mission is to 'bring the sunshine into other people's lives'.</p>

                            <p> It is a valuable quality, and they should not neglect it. Surprisingly, they are often sensitive and get hurt very easily. Not that they will demonstrate it. If they are treated unjustly, they will show great magnanimity. But
                                if they get really angry, they will put on the full regal act at once. They will 'mount the throne' and make it clear in no uncertain terms that the impertinent fool who has been stupid enough to consider himself as equal,
                                steps back to his `proper place.'</p>

                            <p>People born in this sign have obvious faults. They can be intolerant, pompous and over dogmatic. A Leo should make a habit of reassessing their opinion as often as possible. They should try and make use of the natural, spontaneous,

                            <p>Virgo is the sixth sign of the Zodiac; it is also the second earthly sign. The planet Mercury rules it. They are generally tall and have a slim physique. They have prominent and thick eyebrows. They have dark hair and attractive
                                face. Due to their active nature and inclination towards physical activities they will have robust health and look much younger than their actual age. Due to the strong presence of Mercury, Virgos would always be knowledgeable.
                                They will be well read and will be able to provide information on large and varied topics.</p>

                            <p> They are sensitive, trustworthy, generous and self-conscious by nature. They cannot see the pain of others and go out of the way to help those in need. Mercury also makes Virgos very methodical and systematic, they verify their
                                work twice to make sure there is no mistake. They are hard working, extremely practical and with a great appetite for details. They thrive on constant activity and have a lot of nervous energy to burn. The trouble is that
                                they find it very difficult to relax and get nervous even over very small things. They find relaxation in the work and hence always remain restless. If Mercury, the ruling planet, is in Libra, there will be a greater ability
                                to relax.</p>

                            <p>Precision and neatness are natural to them and go with purity that is depicted by the symbol of sun sign itself. They appreciate things of beauty and they are very tidy by nature and like to keep there surrounding highly clean.
                                They possess a very analytical and logical mind so in their conversations they try to give as much details as possible. Being highly refined and sophisticated Virgos expect too much from others. They are generally not satisfied
                                with others work and try to pick mistakes in their work. The Virgo's flair for details dominates their personality. Mercury has a powerful bearing on the Virgo's going off on a tangent. However, if Virgo is the Sun-sign
                                and Mercury is in Leo, the native will have a better grasp of the total situation than otherwise.</p>

                        <span class="section-subtitle">Highly Reserved, Docile, Imaginative, Pleasant, Courteious, Creative and Elegant, Sensitive and Possessive</span>
                        <div class="product-details">
                            <p>This is the seventh sign of the Zodiac, which is governed by the planet Venus. People born in this sign are generally tall, athletic and strong. They possess charming personality, sweet smile and attractive eyes. Venus the
                                ruler makes Libran highly reserved, docile, sensitive and possessive. Being an airy sign a Libran will tend to be highly imaginative, pleasant, courteous, creative and elegant individual. They are cool-headed people who
                                do not get into hot discussions easily. Incase they get angry there anger is short-lived and they get calm very soon. They are fashionable and trendy people, who like to spend lavishly on new clothes, jewellery and perfumes.</p>

                            <p> The outstanding characteristics of Librans are their willingness to help those in need. They voluntarily provide financial, moral and psychological support to the ones they care. They are also very social and like to spend
                                time and resources with loved ones. Venus also makes Librans highly creative. They will try traditional methods first but if desired results fail, they will try new methods to achieve success. As Librans are simple, noble
                                and benevolent people they tend to be fooled very easily. They need to choose their associates very carefully. Librans enjoy excellent convincing power. They are good at expressing themselves about all aspects of life,
                                and people around them must generously endorse their statements.</p>

                            <p>A Libran avoids quarrels and confrontations. Indecisiveness marks their personality and is their worst fault. 'One must wait and see what happens' they say and they will wait, putting off decisions for as long as possible.
                                They have a reputation for being lazy. Often Librans are not as soft as they appear to be. They are fairly eager to achieve what they want, but they may appear lazy due to indecisiveness. They may adopt a pose of charming
                                inactivity. This may be simply a pause between one activity and the next or may be a well thought out decision. The Libran may be indecisive, but when they do decide that they want something, they generally get it, somehow
                                or the other. They make excellent host. Their homes are comfortable and guests find the atmosphere relaxing.<br> Although Librans enjoy good financial position, they tend to be highly spendthrifts. Librans are good companions
                                as they are sincere, honest and highly caring.<br> If the ruling planet Venus is afflicted in any manner in ones birth chart then it would give altogether negative results.</p>

                            <p>Scorpio is the eighth sign of the zodiac and is influenced by the planet Mars. Scorpio tends to be tall, highly muscular, have commanding appearance and an excellent personality. The dominating Mars makes Scorpio very independent,
                                responsible, bold, courageous, dignified, assertive and energetic. As Scorpio is a watery sign it has a creative mind and sharp memory..</p>

                            <p>They might not know their ability, but in large groups a Scorpio will easily outsmart others. They possess strong will power and are highly motivated people. They will not rest in peace till they complete jobs in hand. Scorpio
                                tends to have an active mind that is always searching for new ideas. They are an explorer of new intelligent horizons. They have great stamina, and never shy away from a challenge. They are always willing to take risk facing
                                the unknown. The strong Mars also as its adverse effect, as it makes Scorpios highly short-tempered. They will get irritated very easily and tend to behave rash and highly unpredictable at times. Generally Scorpio is lucky
                                when it comes to finances.</p>

                            <p>The Scorpion is passionate about everything that they do, be it work, play or politics. A peculiar intensity permeates their whole personality, giving them an extremely strong sense of purpose in life, and a determination to
                                do nothing half-heartedly.<br> They could be very jealous, not only in love but in other spheres of life also. Whoever holds a position to which the Scorpio feels entitled will be disliked, and then they can even resort
                                to some kind of victimization or even cruelty. Their enormous powerful energy gives them a deep insight into every thing that people cannot understand them easily. If this energy is properly utilized, it can give the Scorpio
                                great qualities of endurance. They will battle against all odds to win - sometimes to the point of trampling on others in the process.<br> When they realize that things have become dull, a Scorpio may not find it difficult
                                to charter a new course. They may, for reasons obscure to others, destroy what they had built and start all over again.</p>

                        <div class="product-details">
                            <p>Sagittarius is the ninth sign of the Zodiac, which is ruled by the planet Jupiter. People born under this sign have fair complexion, graceful looks, impressive eyes, large forehead and charming personality. It is a fiery sign;
                                therefore those born tend to be bold, courageous and highly daring. They are positive, fearless and ambitious people. They will not jitter in adverse conditions and have strength to fight with determination and conviction.</p>

                            <p> They are highly knowledgeable, but they learn less from books and more while day-to-day interaction with people. Jupiter the ruler makes them highly broadminded, strong and lively. They have keen interest in sports and out
                                door activities. They are active and always in motion. Their heart and mind is always searching for new experiences. They always prefer life around themselves and run away from solitude and isolation. Sagittarius born is
                                highly articulate and a fine public speaker; they know how to get ideas across to other people.</p>

                            <p>They are great learners and learn more from their mistakes than people of any other sign. A Sagittarian may be careless in his youth, driving fast cars, paying scant regard for safety, but once he commits a mistake, he will
                                never repeat it. Although his delight in personal freedom never leaves him, he will eventually be able to make full use of formidable intellectual potential, studying serious, perhaps philosophical subjects. He will particularly
                                enjoy exploring subjects unknown to him. He stores knowledge and puts it to good use later. He sets his own standards. He will set his sight on an objective, which may seem beyond him, but once it is well within reach,
                                he would raise his sight further higher and become eager to start a new project before he completes the one in hand.</p>
                            <p>He always wants to feel free. He cannot stand the feeling of claustrophobia, either physical or emotional. His desire to explore the unknown may well be both physical and intellectual. His life must always have an element of
                                challenge. It's not unusual for him to hold on to two jobs at one time. As he indulges in a great deal of intellectual exercise, he also needs to have a fair amount of physical exercise. Getting tired means, he is bored
                                and requires a change. He must make efforts to keep this restlessness under control, as otherwise it will cause considerable unhappiness to himself as well as to his partner.</p>

                                loneliness, desperation, disappointments and feeling of insecurity and depressions also mark their personality and these things could cause sleeplessness, digestive disorders, blood pressure, diabetes and melancholy at
